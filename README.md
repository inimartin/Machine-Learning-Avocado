# Machine-Learning-Avocado

Final project of my Machine Learning course from my double degree in Law and Business Analytics, made in colaboration with my partner Santiago Aliaga (github: https://github.com/saliagaestella). 

A complete study of the US avocado industry. Carriying out an EDA on the industry and a predictive analysis using different models to predict the avocado's price.

All datasets were obtained from Hass Avocado Board (https://hassavocadoboard.com/volume-data-projections/), a magnificient website with the best data and info about the american avocado market.
